Neutron star merger r-process
=============================

Program for simulation of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star
merger scenario. It uses SkyNet library for nuclear network simulation
and actually just extends one of basic SkyNet usage examples.


TODO
----
- Write SkyNet installation guide, as it is a bit tricky.
- Add references to README.
- Write comments in r-process.cpp explaining what is going on.
- Fix FitSpline.cpp (unnecessary class, but who knows).


Build and run
-------------
Make sure that SkyNet and PARDISO paths in Makefile are correct,
then run 'make' to compile program.

Binary ./run starts r-process simulation. Binary ./test is used for
testing custom classes, implemented in ext/ dir.


SkyNet installation
-------------------
TODO


SkyNet hacking
--------------
There are cases when user needs to extend SkyNet or just debug it to
undestand how it works. To make it debugable via gdb rebuild it with
'Debug' option:
  
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DSKYNET_MATRIX_SOLVER=<solver> \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<install_dir> <repo_dir>
  make -j4 install

This option disables building optimization, that confuses gdb.
