r-process simulation backup
===========================

Here I store my r-process simulation program, its results and some additional
scripts. Also there are some modifications of the REACLIB database. Repo is a
mess but I don't want to lose it.

I don't save *.h5 files because they are too large.

*.cpp code uses SkyNet library for astrophysical nucleosynthesis, build with 
Intel MKL library. There are two *.cpp files, that differ slightly: one is for
neutron star binary r-process and another is for a simple canonical model.
